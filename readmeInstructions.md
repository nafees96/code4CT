  <!-- how to create coursers page:
  -object constructor to creat courses page.
  -the user must be able to click on the course.
  -the course we have  method which we add it to a basket/or a  cart(should be able to add and remove,amount)
  -the basket or cart would show the number of coursers you signed out.the duration / description.
  -if a course  is signed up/added and use reverse functionality .
  - objects are great tools when programming tools, they can be used to get info aboutr a particular thing without creating a multiple value
  -methods ,constructive functions and prototypes might be the best way to make this page
